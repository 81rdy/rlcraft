# RLCraft

I couldn't find an easy working deployment, so I made my own.

Currently RLCraft version 2.8.1

Uses https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server, with custom configuration to make Forge work.

## Usage

Requires Docker and docker-compose.

```
git clone git@github.com:BernardZhao/rlcraft.git
cd rlcraft
docker-compose up -d
```
